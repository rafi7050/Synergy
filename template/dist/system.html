            <h1>Our system</h1>
            <br>

            <p>In a world which is facing huge environmental challenges, our economy and our society need to adapt
                themselves to this growing threath. Climate change, increase in population, destruction of biosphere
                are all problems that need to be tackled to guarantee thriving societies and cultures. To include those
                environmental concerns without our production and consumption system, we need to develop innovation that 
                are allowing for sustainable solutions. Indeed, at the rythm we are going if we want to maintain our standards 
                of living, we will have to make some concessions with regards to our way of consuming. But this shall not be enough,
                and we also have to make sure that our way of producing is alligned with environmental standards. Which is why
                we need innovation for sustainability. Developping such innovation is a challenge in itself as various dimensions
                need to be considered, such as the environmental impact, the social one, and the financial return. 
            </p>

            <p>To ease the challenge for organizations, it has been advocated to use collaboration to share the efforts, and to
                develop new ways of thinking. Collaboration shall allow organizations to discover new ways of doing, new technologies, 
                hence to set themselves on the right path. However, finding the right partner for collaboration can be an hassel
                as new technologies are being developped all around the glober, often in a hidden manner. Hence, there is a tremdendeous
                loss with regards to exisiting innovation. Organizations are simply not aware that a technology or a business process
                suitable to help them become more sustainable already exist. Therefore, this platform will hope to help to increase communication
                between the different parties, and match them to allow them to successfully collaborate. To achieve this goal a match-making tool has been
                put into place. This tool is based on a selection of hierarchical criteria, which should help to define the true need of each
                collaboration. See below to view the strcture of the tool. 
            </p>

            <p>First, the organization joining the platform need to define the sustainable area in which they seek cooperation. As mentioned
                previously, sustainability encompasses various different dimensions. Indeed, the impact of human kind on the nature influences 
                various ecosystem. Those includes the pollution of water, the increase of CO2 in the air, the destruction of resources, etc. Hence,
                an organization must be sure to first consider the area of interets. In accordance with this logic, the following areas are present
                on the platform
                <ul>
                    <li>Transparent Supply Chain Solutions: this aspect refers to all exisitng solutions that help companies and organizations
                        put forward the impact of their supply chain. This shall include the auditor entity, the platform to share the information
                        with the customers, or the entity establishing the standards.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sustainable Energy Solutions: This dimensions refers to the sustainable energy solutions, thus considering the source of energy,
                        it transfers, its management to guarantee the most efficient system.
                    </li>
                    <li>Future of Urbanization: this area refers to all the technologies for development of cities that are respectfuel of the environment,
                        such as green buldings, inclusive areas, and sustainable energies sources.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                A specific project could overlap with different area. Indeed, solar energy for example could also be used to help develop
                more sustainable cities. Once that the desire behind collaboration has been defined, it's important then to provide an overiew
                of each area, to indicate the typologies of all the actors, to allow for an user to define where would value-creation be more suitable
                for it. This shall thus lead to the second part of the strcture of the matching tool.
            </p>
            <p>Second, once the area of collaboration has been defined, it is important to understand how the system of this area works. For more information on
                as specific area, please refers to following link for each area.
                <ul>
                    <li>Transparent Supply Chain Solutions: Here what is important is to understand the cycle of this system.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Concerned citizens - communities demand transparence.</li> 
                            <li>Governemnt - certification establish regulations to respect the demanded transparence.</li> 
                            <li>Companies - supplier need to adapt their business model to those regulations, and want to share it with their stakehodlers.</li> 
                            <li>Auditors - technologies verify the good-will of each company to guarantee that they are indeed respecting the regulations.</li> 
                            <li>Platform - experts communicate the results of the audit to increase information for the end-customers on each organization.</li> 
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Sustainable Energy Solutions: 
                    </li>
                    <li>Future of Urbanization:
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Third, once one or more organizations fitting the requirement for collaboration as been identified, then the parties can match to
                initate the value-creation process </p>
